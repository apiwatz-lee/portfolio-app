        description:`I am Thai with Chinese heritage, born and raised in a warm family in Hat Yai, Thailand. 
        My father has a great passion for computers, so I've had the opportunity to play with computers since I was a child. 
        Our house even has a dedicated computer room.
        I still don't know exactly what I like, but I do know that I enjoy playing computer games. 
        However, being a kid hooked on games seemed like a phase that lasted longer than expected.`,

        I thought pursuing a degree in Business Administration (BBA) made sense. 
        My plan was to graduate and contribute to managing the family business.`,
