        My father has a strong interest in computers, so I had the opportunity to play with computers since I was a child. 
        Our house even has a dedicated computer room.
        Back then, I wasn't sure about my interests, 
        but I knew I enjoyed playing computer games.
        However, being a kid who spent a lot of time with games seemed somewhat excessive.

        I thought pursuing a degree in Business Administration (BBA) made sense. 
        My plan was to graduate and contribute to managing the family business.`,

        I am confident that what I do can contribute positively to the people in my life`,
